Optional Problems: How Much Coal to Run a Light Bulb

A joule is an amount of energy and a watt is a rate of energy utilization, defined as 1 W = 1 J/s.
How many joules of energy are needed to run a 100 W light bulb for one day? Save your answer to use in the next question.
A: 8640000 J

Coal has about 30E6 J of energy per kg, but a power plant can only use 30% of this energy to produce electricity (i.e. it is 30% efficient).
How many kilograms of coal need to be burned to light a 100 W light bulb for one day?
A: 0.96 kg
