Initial part to understand and learn to manipulate units in general.

Ex 1. 
If you are traveling at 60 km per hour, how many meters per second is that? (Choose the answer below that is closest)
A: 15 m/s

Ex 2.

Optional Problems: How Much Coal to Run a Light Bulb

A joule is an amount of energy and a watt is a rate of energy utilization, defined as 1 W = 1 J/s.
How many joules of energy are needed to run a 100 W light bulb for one day? Save your answer to use in the next question.
A: 8640000 J

Coal has about 30E6 J of energy per kg, but a power plant can only use 30% of this energy to produce electricity (i.e. it is 30% efficient).
How many kilograms of coal need to be burned to light a 100 W light bulb for one day?
A: 0.96 kg

Optional Problems: Comparing Energy Prices

1. A gallon of gasoline carries with it about 1.3 x 10^(8) Joules of energy. If you pay $5 per gallon, how many megaJoules can you get for a dollar?
A: 26 MJ

2. Electricity goes for about $0.05 per kilowatt hour. A kilowatt hour is just a weird way to write Joules, since a Watt is a Joule per second, and a kilowatt hour is the number of Joules one would get from running 1000 Watts times one hour (3600 seconds). In the form of electricity, how many megaJoules can you get for a dollar?
A: 72 MJ

3. A standard cubic foot of natural gas carries with it about 1.1 x 10^(6) Joules of energy. You can get about 5 x 10^(5) BTU's of gas for a dollar, and there are about 1030 BTU's in a standard cubic foot. How many megaJoules of energy in the form of natural gas can you get for a dollar?
A: 534 MJ

4. A ton of coal holds about 3.2 x 10^(10) Joules of energy, and costs about $40. How many megaJoules of energy in the form of coal can you get for a dollar?
A: 800

5. Corn oil (biodiesel) costs about $0.10 per fluid ounce wholesale. A fluid ounce carries about 240 dietary calories (which a scientist would call kilocalories). A calorie is about 4.2 Joules. How many megaJoules of energy in the form of corn oil can you get for a dollar?
A: 10

6. Question 6
What is the ratio of the cost of the most expensive form of energy (in $/MJ, not MJ/$) to the cost of the cheapest form?
A: 100

7. Which is the cheapest form of energy on your list?
A: Coal

8. Which is the most expensive?
A: Biodiesel
